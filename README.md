# DJXamarinCodeTemplates

A collection of daily-work code-templates I use in Xamarin Studio

The templates are convenience-templates for things I use a lot. They include templates specific to MvvmCross, as it is part of our standard-setup of Xamarin-projects.

The .gitignore is setup to ignore all files except itself, the README.md, the LICENSE and all files beginning with "Dj".

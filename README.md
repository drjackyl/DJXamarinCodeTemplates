# DJXamarinCodeTemplates

A collection of daily-work code-templates I use in Xamarin Studio.

The templates are convenience-templates for things I use a lot. They include templates specific to MvvmCross, as it is part of our standard-setup of Xamarin-projects.

The .gitignore is setup to ignore all files except itself, the README.md, the LICENSE and all files beginning with "Dj".

## How to use these snippets/code-templates

Naming is a bit inconsistent here. the "template"-files are stored in the snippets-directory and while being more like snippets, within Xamarin they are called "Code Templates". Anyways.

The user's code-templates in Xamarin are located in

```
~/Library/XamarinStudio-6.0/Snippets
```

If you did not create your own code-templates, yet and don't plan to do so, you can simply clone this repository to the path mentioned above.

If you have your own code-templates and want to add these, I suggest to clone these to any location and copy them to your Snippets-folder.
